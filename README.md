# Evaluating and Predicting Academic Performance

![Project Logo](images/project_logo.png)

## Abstract

The evaluation and prediction of academic performance are essential tasks for educational institutions. This project utilizes machine learning models to analyze factors such as past marks, hobbies, gender, study time, parentâ€™s background, absenteeism, and attendance. By leveraging models like Linear Regression and Bayesian Classification, this project aims to predict future academic outcomes. This helps educators and students understand areas of improvement and enhance overall performance.

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML) enables software applications to improve predictions without explicit programming. In this project, ML models analyze student data to provide insights into performance drivers and predictors.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning trains models with labeled data to predict outcomes. Models like Linear Regression and Bayesian Classification are used in this project to predict academic performance based on input variables.

### Technologies Used

#### Programming Language: Python

Python is chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries supporting machine learning and data analysis.

#### Libraries Used:

- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tools.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library providing tools for data mining and data analysis.

## Project Structure


## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place datasets in the `data/` directory.
   - Use `notebooks/` for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Run scripts in `src/` to preprocess data (`data_processing.py`), train models (`model_training.py`), and evaluate performance (`evaluation.py`).

4. **Prediction**:
   - Use `prediction.py` script to make predictions based on trained models.
